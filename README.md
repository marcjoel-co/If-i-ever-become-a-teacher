# If I Ever Become a Teacher

Coming from my mom (a teacher), most people say that I will become a teacher one day, rather than a programmer.

Being a people pleaser—a well-known people pleaser to a point—I'm pleased to say I'm going to follow both of my passions.

This repository is dedicated not just to me learning computer science. helping others learn computer science
(those are just for show, i just want that succulent green box)

I will slowly fill this repository with content, starting with C, then progressing to C++, Java, and Python++. Each language will be used to demonstrate progressively more advanced concepts. 

### Purpose of the Repository
This repository is based on what I'm currently studying. I'll do my best to create code as if I were a teacher, focusing on clear explanations, structured progression, and real-world examples. Every piece of code will be crafted with the goal of helping others learn, step by step.
